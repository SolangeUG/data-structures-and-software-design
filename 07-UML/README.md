## Requirements

**This project implements a design that is specified using a UML class diagram.**

The UML class diagram below represents a game involving mazes that consist of rooms:

![UML Class Diagram](Class_Diagram.jpg)

Implement the design in Java by creating classes according to the class diagram and following these guidelines:

- You do not have to actually implement the methods and game logic, of course, but your **code must compile** : you can have methods return null as needed.
- You do not need to worry about any sort of main method or other classes/methods; just represent the classes as shown above.
- All fields and methods should be **public** (that’s what the little plus-sign next to the method names indicates). You do not need to worry about getters and setters.
- All **classes** and **interfaces** must be **public**.
- All **concrete classes** should have a no-argument constructor.
- Use **arrays** to implement multiplicity.
- `MapSite` should be an **abstract class** with a concrete `enter` method that does nothing.

## Note

All classes must be in the default package, i.e. there should be no “package” declaration at the top of the source code.
